# Forge — Frontend

**The mentorship management system for the KamiLimu Programme.**

Forge is the operational backbone of KamiLimu, a structured eight-month mentorship programme for undergraduate students in Kenya. This repository contains the frontend application. The backend lives in a separate repository maintained by Mark Tanui.

## What Forge Does

KamiLimu has historically run its operations across Google Sheets, Google Forms, and ad hoc email and WhatsApp communication. Forge replaces this with a purpose-built web platform that manages cohort sessions, attendance, points, graduation eligibility, leaderboards, skill tracking, competitions, and extra activities across six distinct user roles.

---

## User Roles

| Role | What they do in Forge |
|---|---|
| Mentee | Track attendance, points, skill progress, graduation status, log extra activities |
| 1:1 Peer Mentor | Monitor assigned mentee group, manage peer mentorship tasks, keep private notes |
| ICT Peer Mentor | Track ICT track mentees, contribute resources, log technical progress notes |
| Professional Mentor | View assigned sessions, read aggregated feedback, manage session resources |
| Committee | Read-only access across everything in the cohort |
| System Admin | Full access, user management, cohort configuration, system settings |

## Architecture

```
[Browser]
    |
    | HTTP REST + JWT
    v
[forge-frontend: React on Vercel]
    |
    | HTTP REST + JWT
    v
[forge-backend: FastAPI on Railway]
    |
    | queries + RLS
    v
[Supabase: PostgreSQL + Auth]
    |
    | DMs + channel notifications
    v
[Slack API]
```

This repo is the frontend only. It consumes the backend REST API. It does not connect to Supabase or Slack directly.

## API Contract

All backend endpoints are documented at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the backend is running locally. Read this before building any component that fetches data. The API client lives at `src/lib/api.ts` — all API calls go through this file.
